I don't know what to write in a read me file, but...

This is my first successful attempt at drawing shadows with opengl
The code itself is a mess, but it works
pressing a or d will move the light, pressing left and right will move the camera, pressing space will invert colors 
anyway, the depth comparison code part thing took me more than 3 hours of rewriting the same 10 lines, so appreciate it.
